Commentpress Child Theme
========================

This is a basic child theme for Commentpress. Use it as a "starter pack" for creating your own look and feel.

Please note: this child theme only works with the official [Commentpress theme](https://github.com/IFBook/CommentPressTheme) and Commentpress must be properly installed before using it.

## Installation ##

Please install and activate the theme by doing the following:

1. Unzip the .zip file and, if needed, rename the enclosing folder so that the theme's files are located directly inside `/wp-content/themes/commentpress-child`.
2. NOTE: you may need to edit the line in `style.css` that says `Template: commentpress` if your parent Commentpress theme does not live in a folder called `commentpress`. If it does not, change this to `Template: YOURFOLDERNAME`.
3. You may also need to edit the path to the Commentpress stylesheet in `style.css` as per step 2 above.
2. Activate the theme.
3. Visit settings pages and configure theme.
4. You are done!
